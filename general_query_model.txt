Vague references to international drug trade without identification of
the organization(s) involved would not be relevant.

<narr>   
Documents are relevant that show the Hubble telescope has produced 
new data, better quality data than previously available, data that 
has increased human knowledge of the universe, or data that has led
to disproving previously existing theories or hypotheses.  Documents
limited to the shortcomings of the telescope would be irrelevant.  
Details of repairs or modifications to the telescope without

<narr>   
Any document identifying a mammal as endangered is relevant.  
Statements of authorities disputing the endangered status would also
be relevant.  A document containing information on habitat and
populations of a mammal identified elsewhere as endangered would also
be relevant even if the document at hand did not identify the species
as endangered.  Generalized statements about endangered species

<title> Most Dangerous Vehicles 

<desc>   
Which are the most crashworthy, and least crashworthy, 
passenger vehicles?
 
<narr>   
A relevant document will contain information on the 
crashworthiness of a given vehicle or vehicles that 
can be used to draw a comparison with other vehicles.  
The document will have to describe/compare vehicles, 
not drivers.  For instance, it should be expected 
that vehicles preferred by 16-25 year-olds would be 
involved in more crashes, because that age group is
involved in more crashes.  I would view number of 
fatalities per 100 crashes to be more revealing of 
a vehicle's crashworthiness than the number of
crashes per 100,000 miles, for example.

purpose, problems, and consequences is desirable.

<narr>   
Relevant documents would contain as a minimum a clear statement 
that a hydroelectric project is planned or construction is under 
way and the location of the project.  Renovation of existing
facilities would be judged not relevant unless plans call for a
significant increase in acre-feet or reservoir or a marked change
in the environmental impact of the project.  Arguments for and
against proposed projects are relevant as long as they are supported 
by specifics, including as a minimum the name or location of the
project.  A statement that an individual or organization is for or
against such projects in general would not be relevant.  Proposals
or projects underway to dismantle existing facilities or drain
existing reservoirs are not relevant, nor are articles reporting a
decision to drop a proposed plan.

What are the advantages and/or disadvantages of tooth implants?

<narr>   
A tooth replacement procedure, begun in the 1960s by Doctor
Branemark, is becoming more widely used today.  It involves 
the replacement of a lost tooth/teeth by an implantation 
process which secures the fabricated tooth to a titanium post
with an adhesive resulting in a stable and sturdy denture 
almost like the original.  A relevant document will include 
any clinical experiment, report, study, paper, or medical 
discussion which describes the advantages or disadvantages of 
tooth implant(s), conditions under which such a procedure is 
favorable, denture comfort and function compared to false teeth, 
bridge, or plate and comparative cost differential.

<title> Rap and Crime 

<desc>   
Evidence that rap music has a negative effect on young people.

<narr>   
The lyrics to Rap music are replete with words which degrade
women, glorify drug abuse, the killing of policemen and even
romanticize suicide.  A crusade was begun a few years ago in
which the music industry was asked "to clean up its act" 
because of the detrimental effect it was having upon teenagers.  
There were some instances in which teenagers, who demonstrated 
no sign of internal strife, committed suicide.  The only clues
to their self-destruction were notes found near the bodies with
lyrics from Rap songs relating to suicide.  A relevant item 
should include any psychological study, evidence, poll, 
documentation, or psychological opinion that Rap music has a 
deleterious effect upon young people and has led to a discernible
change in personality, life style, crime, alteration of personality
or any other negative effect upon the psyche, mores, and culture
of teenagers.

Persons living near radio towers and more recently persons using
car phones have been diagnosed with brain cancer.  The argument 
rages regarding the direct association of one with the other.
The incidence of cancer among the groups cited is considered, by
some, to be higher than that found in the normal population.  A 
relevant document includes any experiment with animals, statistical 
study, articles, news items which report on the incidence of brain 
cancer being higher/lower/same as those persons who live near a 
radio tower and those using car phones as compared to those in the 
general population.

Document will discuss the theft of trade secrets along with 
the sources of information:  trade journals, business meetings,
data from Patent Offices, trade shows, or analysis of a 
competitor's products.

<narr>   
A relevant document will contain specific information on the
theft of trade secrets on new or existing technology.  Relevant
information includes, but is not limited to, espionage in the
highly competitive fashion industry, toy companies, drug firms,
and computer companies.  An apparently legal way of stealing
company secrets is by using the Freedom of Information Act, 
passed by the U.S. Congress in 1966 to help people and the 
press get information for the public good.  The law has often
been used instead by companies for private gain.  Documents
discussing company counterespionage are also considered to be
relevant.

<title> Polygamy Polyandry Polygyny  

<desc>   
A look at the roots and prevalence of polygamy 
in the world today.

<narr>   
Polygamy is a form of marriage which permits a
person to have more than one husband or wife.
Polyandry refers to one woman sharing two or 
more husbands at the same time.  Polygyny refers
to one man sharing two or more wives at the 
same time.  Primary focus of the search will be
the prevalence of these practices in the world
today and societal attitudes towards these
practices.  Also relevant would be discussions
of the roots and practical sources of these
customs.  A modern development in this area is
serial polygamy, a phrase coined to label the
practice of men who take a series of wives in
sequence as a solution to practical welfare,
considerations of child care, housing, etc.
Documents discussing serial polygamy will not
be considered relevant.

of possible new fuel sources is also of relevance.
Relevant documents can also show how much current
fuel sources are available, however, articles
which simply refer to current sources are not
relevant.  Documents about nuclear power are 
relevant only if they discuss new developments in
the nuclear field, such as the processing of spent
fuel to establish a new nuclear fuel system.

<narr>   
A relevant document will address the questions of how 
and why, and to what degree, bacteria are able to fend 
off the curative effects of antibiotics.  Overuse of 
antibiotics, as well as the increasing use of antibiotics
in promoting the growth of crops and animals whose food

software to ensure the secrecy of communications

considered such software to be subject to the same
export controls as munitions, and has sought to 
restrict the export of encryption software unless 
it contains a device which could allow the U.S. to
read the underlying messages.  Business interests

A relevant document would contain reports on what
new steps airports worldwide have taken to better 
scrutinize passengers and their luggage on 
international flights and to step up screening of
all carry-on baggage.  With the increase in 
international terrorism and in the wake of the
TWA Flight 800 disaster, articles on airport 
security relating in particular to additional
steps taken by airports to increase flight safety
would be relevant.  The mere mention of enhanced 
security does not constitute relevance.  Additional
steps refer to something beyond just passenger

Examples of new steps would be additional personnel, 
sophisticated monitoring and screening devices, 
and extraordinary measures to check luggage in the
